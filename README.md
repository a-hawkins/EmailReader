# EmailReader
A proof of concept super basic email reader script in Python.   
   
   
Note 1: This is not at all a secure way to access an email account.   
This is more of an academic exercise/starting point to begin to understand IMAP in python.   
   
Note 2: To use this script with an email account, you may need to enable IMAP and access from less secure apps in your email account settings to prevent this script from being blocked.
